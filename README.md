==========

SnowScreen is a wintry screensaver for Microsoft® Windows. The Qt5-based executable shows falling snowflake upon your screen. This piece of software is Open Source, licensed under the GPL Version 3.
If you have questions, feel free to contact me via E-Mail <c.gundler@mail.de>.

Install:
  1. Get a compiled version of SnowScreen (you can download it or compile it yourself)
  2. Rightclick the "*.scr"
  3. Choose "Install"
  4. DONE! - That wasn't so hard was it? ;)

Deinstall:
  1. Delete all files of SnowScreen
  2. Delete the hive "HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Christopher Gundler/SnowScreen" in Microsoft® Windows Registry.

ToDo:
  * Options for changing the background colors
  * Better preview

Special thanks:
  * I would like to express particular thanks to Leon Pielage, who designed the nice snowflake.
